# 🐹 Go Engineering Journey

Welcome to my personal journey of learning the **Go (Golang)** programming language.  
This repository documents everything I learn — from fundamentals to building real-world backend systems.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repo serves as a structured journal of my progress in mastering Go.  
Inside, you’ll find:

- 📘 **Notes** on Go syntax, concepts, and best practices  
- 🧪 **Experiments** exploring concurrency, goroutines, channels, error handling, and more  
- 🛠️ **Mini projects** to apply knowledge into actual use cases  
- 🧩 **Practice problems** and solutions  
- 📂 **Clean folder structure** for scalable learning

My goal is to develop a strong foundation in Go that aligns with real-world **software engineering**, **backend development**, and **system-level programming**.
